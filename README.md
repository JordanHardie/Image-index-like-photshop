How to use:
  - If you are using an existing ACT file then simply drop the file in the same directory as the python files and rename it to 'custom_palette.act'.
  - Otherwise you can generate an ACT file by using the act_palette_generator.py program. By default it makes an ACT file with red, green, blue and black only.
    But it's pretty easy to modify the table to whatever you desire. Same goes for it only accepting jpg files, you can just change it png files or whatever, it should work.
