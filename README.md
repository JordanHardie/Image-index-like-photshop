How to use:
  - If you are using an existing ACT file then simply drop the file in the same directory as the python files and rename it to 'custom_palette.act'.
  - Otherwise you can generate an ACT file by using the act_palette_generator.py program. By default it makes an ACT file with red, green, blue and black only.
    But it's pretty easy to modify the table to whatever you desire. Same goes for it only accepting jpg files, you can just change it to accept png files or whatever, it should work.

Details:
  - The example image can be found at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Yuji_jinja_shrine_20190114_01.jpg
  - The example image was converted with the 'custom_palette.act' and 'output_image' is the corresponding output.
    The same image was also converted with the 'example_custom_palette.act' and likewise the 'example_output_image.png' is the output for that.
